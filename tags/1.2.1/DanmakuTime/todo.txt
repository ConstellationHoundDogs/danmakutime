
[x] Fullscreen may not work on all systems, therefore prefs.xml must be saved
    tp the save folder so it may be edited.
[x] The first call to yield() from a LuaFunctionLink fails.
[x] F5 doesn't work when the Lua code contains a compile error
[x] Activate the netplay through the scripting language instead of from the
    beginning? We'd need to take some care to resync the frame variables as
    they could be drastically different for different players. Reset the
    frame to 0 while connecting?
    Upon netplay activation, restart() is called.
[x] A damage flash on enemies? Implement by spawning a thread (to avoid
    hindering game creators from overriding either update or animate)?
[x] Give sprites their own thread pool?
[x] The # operator doesn't return the length of a Java array.
    The luaLength operation isn't overridden for LUserData. It should forward
    to a length method in the metatable? I already support a length operation,
    I should use the same one for both occasions.
[x] Replays.
    Use GameEnv.fromGame() to store the initial state, then store the IInput
    each frame. I can't save the Lua state, so replays may only be started
    after calls to Game.restart()? I need to add a startGame() function that
    works like globalReset(), but somehow allows me to pass the selected
    players. Always store a replay of a game. The choice to save a replay is
    up to the script. It can call saveReplay(String name) if/when it wants to
    save.
    
[x] I want to be able to add threads to spellcards. 
[x] Change all enemies/shots into point items after a spellcard ends
    I can use a large object with enemyDetectorColType/enemyShotDetectorColType
    col nodes filling the entire playing field.    
[x] Add a script textbox to the applet.html file

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Release v1.2
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[x] Write SystemInfo results to file
[x] Add a way to use left-control and right-control as special keys. Maybe I
    can add special cases to UserInput for Ctrl, Shift, Alt.
[x] When any player dies, the restart screen pops up. It should only appear
    when all players are out of lives.

[ ] Add a way to stop/control the replay playback    
[ ] This silliness with the boundingrectradius needs to stop, a proper bounding
    rect is much more accurate. A more limited bounding rect could reduce the
    number of grid cells we sould need to check in ColGrid.
    Or I could intersect the object with the colgrid cells in some way? 
[ ] 3D backgrounds?
[ ] Add an EdgeRule enum {CLAMP, WRAP} to allow the colfield to be use for tube
    shooters?
