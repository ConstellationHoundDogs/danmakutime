Feature requests:
[ ] Collision detection doesn't scale well. Try to use some kind of space
    subdivision (uniform grid)?
[x] Implement scriptable collision handling
    
[ ] Is it possible to script a player?
[ ] Create a "Boss extends Sprite" object to help with Boss creation? Or is
    such an object better created from Lua?
    
[ ] How does the user specify which SoundEngine they want?
[ ] There should be two separate anchors for the TextDrawable:
    1. text box anchor
    2. text inside the box anchor
[ ] Support rendering of IStyledText with TextDrawable and Renderer.
