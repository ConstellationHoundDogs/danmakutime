
Bugs:
[ ] The javalualib returns an LMethod without checking if any method with
    that name actually exists. This is probably because overloading must be
    resolved at call time (we don't know which function exactly will be needed)
    It should return null if no method with that name exists.
    I SHOULD IMPLEMENT MY OWN VERSION OF LuajavaLib.java    
[ ] Lua's include/require functions are broken.
[ ] Collision detection between player and items is painfully slow.
	--This is caused by slow method lookup, when taking storing the values of
	self.setPos, self.getX and self.getY in local variables, the slowdown is
	gone.

Feature requests:
[x] Implement line segment <-> line segment collision test
[ ] Game Menu
[ ] Items
[x] Explosions
[ ] Add an interface for the script to iterate over all objects.
[ ] Create thlib.lua which defines a THSprite {hp, power, grazed}
	and other things you'd need like a player script, items, etc.
[ ] Think about bosses with lifebars, timeouts and spellcards. How would one
    implement those and how can I help.
[ ] Create a "Boss extends Sprite" object to help with Boss creation? Or is
    such an object better created from Lua?
[ ] Document the collision interfaces    
[ ] How does the user specify which SoundEngine they want?
[ ] Add scale attributes to drawables. Renderer need not change, the drawable
    can handle the width & height change itself in its draw method.
[ ] Try to print a Lua stack trace in case of Lua errors
[ ] This silliness with the boundingrectradius needs to stop, a proper bounding
    rect is much more accurate. A more limited bounding rect could reduce the
    number of grid cells we sould need to check in ColGrid. 
[ ] 3D backgrounds?
