Feature requests:
[ ] Is it possible to script a player?
[ ] Create a "Boss extends Sprite" object to help with Boss creation? Or is
    such an object better created from Lua?

[x] Implement pausing in a way that's accessible from the script and the script
    must also be able to control the pause menu. Perhaps have the pause
    function take a LFunction argument??
[x] Objects should be able to specify which field they want to be spawned in.
    Require it as the first constructor argument and default to 1 if absent?
[x] The blurred screenshot gets drawn instead of any of the rendering from
    LuaRunState. Instead, disable all drawing except field(-1) which can then
    be used to draw the pause menu options.    
    Alternatively, the pause banner gets added as a Drawable and I just make
    functions to modify virtual near and far clipping planes to disable all
    draw calls with z > ??? <--- would be overkill.
    
[ ] Make the BGM cycle-synced to the gameplay (make sure to pause it along with
    the game)

[ ] Support rendering of IStyledText with TextDrawable and Renderer.
