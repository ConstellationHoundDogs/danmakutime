[x] ?? What happens with the clip rect if FBO's aren't available and
    size != virtualSize...

Feature requests:
[x] Create functionality to render text on-screen
[x] Currently, all coordinates are absoute, but things that are in fields
    should have coordinates relative to the field it's in...
    
[ ] Objects should be able to specify which field they want to be spawned in.
    Require it as the first constructor argument and default to 1 if absent?
[ ] Implement pausing in a way that's accessible from the script and the script
    must also be able to control the pause menu. Perhaps have the pause
    function take a LFunction argument??
[ ] Make the BGM cycle-synced to the gameplay (make sure to pause it along with
    the game)
