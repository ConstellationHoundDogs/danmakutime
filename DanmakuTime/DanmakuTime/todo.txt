
Bugs:
[ ] The javalualib returns an LMethod without checking if any method with
    that name actually exists. This is probably because overloading must be
    resolved at call time (we don't know which function exactly will be needed)
    It should return null if no method with that name exists.
    I SHOULD IMPLEMENT MY OWN VERSION OF LuajavaLib.java    

Feature requests:
[x] Collision detection doesn't scale well. Try to use some kind of space
    subdivision (uniform grid)?
[x] Implement scriptable collision handling
    
[ ] Is it possible to script a player?
[ ] Create a "Boss extends Sprite" object to help with Boss creation? Or is
    such an object better created from Lua?
    
[ ] How does the user specify which SoundEngine they want?
[ ] There should be two separate anchors for the TextDrawable:
    1. text box anchor
    2. text inside the box anchor
[ ] Support rendering of IStyledText with TextDrawable and Renderer.
