
Bugs:
[ ] Lua's include/require functions are broken.

Feature requests:
[ ] Think about bosses with lifebars, timeouts and spellcards. How would one
    implement those and how can I help.
[ ] Create a "Boss extends Sprite" object to help with Boss creation? Or is
    such an object better created from Lua?
[ ] Restart level option/on dead menu handler
    
[ ] Document the collision interfaces    
[ ] How does the user specify which SoundEngine they want?
[ ] Add scale attributes to drawables. Renderer need not change, the drawable
    can handle the width & height change itself in its draw method.
[ ] Try to print a Lua stack trace in case of Lua errors
[ ] This silliness with the boundingrectradius needs to stop, a proper bounding
    rect is much more accurate. A more limited bounding rect could reduce the
    number of grid cells we sould need to check in ColGrid. 
[ ] 3D backgrounds?
