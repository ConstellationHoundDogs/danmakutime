
[x] When the player is above the item get line, don't move the items for one
    frame at a time. They need to be magnetized until the player dies.
[x] framerate limiter is more accurate
[x] No vsync in windowed mode. vsync is already forced with Aero, and the
    double vsync obliterates performance when multiple opengl windows are
    active.
[x] Allow for nested img.xml/snd.xml files that are relative to the folders
    they're in.
[x] Create a THShot sprite type which includes an owner and gives the owner
    points upon collision playershot. And dies upon hit
[x] Read initial keyconfig from a file    
[x] Synchronize game data and persistent storage before netplay. The bytes for
    the persistentstorage file can be sent by the server. The resulting
    persistentstorage object should not record any changes on the clients: the
    save method must be overridden to do nothing, as well as the default load
    since that's supposed to be a no-op, but might not be depending on which
    machine you run it on. The host -should- record any changes as normal.
[x] Add a second global preferencestore for use by the Lua scripts to store
    highscores, unlocks, etc.
[x] Joypad support
[x] The quit options corrupts applet mode. How do I end the applet gracefully
[x] How to switch between the number of players? Arcade mode (press fire to
    join)?    
[x] Compare res.zip/res folder before allowing netplay. They must be identical.

 Release v1.1.0        
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
        
[ ] Activate the netplay through the scripting language instead of from the
    beginning? We'd need to take some care to resync the frame variables as
    they could be drastically different for different players. Reset the
    frame to 0 while connecting?
    Upon netplay activation, restart() is called.
[ ] A damage flash on enemies? Implement by spawning a thread (to avoid
    hindering game creators from overriding either update or animate)?
    ^ Give sprites their own thread pool?
[ ] Add an EdgeRule enum {CLAMP, WRAP} to allow the colfield to be use for tube
    shooters?     
[ ] The # operator doesn't return the length of a Java array.
[ ] Try to print a Lua stack trace in case of Lua errors
[ ] Replays
[ ] This silliness with the boundingrectradius needs to stop, a proper bounding
    rect is much more accurate. A more limited bounding rect could reduce the
    number of grid cells we sould need to check in ColGrid.
    Or I could intersect the object with the colgrid cells in some way? 
[ ] 3D backgrounds?
