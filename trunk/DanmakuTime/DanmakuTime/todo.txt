
Bugs:
[ ] Lua's include/require functions are broken.

Feature requests:

=== Day 6 ====================================================================    

[x] Thread.new should pass arguments 2..* to the called function.
[x] Add a globalReset function taking a func + arguments and resetting
    everything except creating a new thread with the supplied function.
[x] Player invincibilityTime after getting hit.
[x] Boss indicator sprite
[x] Add pause/unpause functionality to the script. Game shouldn't be the one
    activating the pause screen. The script wants to be able to pause too when
    the player loses all their lives.
[x] Restart level option/on dead menu handler
[x] How does the user specify which SoundEngine they want?
[x] Helper function for 2d parallax scrolling backgrounds.
[ ] Character dialog boxes?

=== Day 7 ====================================================================    

[ ] Document the collision interfaces    
[ ] Try to print a Lua stack trace in case of Lua errors
[ ] Write documentation on the wiki
[ ] Document how to change build settings / Config settings
[ ] Document how to change between the sound engines

==============================================================================

[ ] Replays
[ ] Key config    
[ ] Joypad support
[ ] This silliness with the boundingrectradius needs to stop, a proper bounding
    rect is much more accurate. A more limited bounding rect could reduce the
    number of grid cells we sould need to check in ColGrid. 
[ ] 3D backgrounds?
