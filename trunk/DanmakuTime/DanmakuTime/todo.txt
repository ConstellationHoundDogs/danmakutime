Feature requests:
[ ] Sprites should have a togglable out-of-bounds death.
    Fields should have a changeable amount of padding where sprites may
    temporarily reside (some room to hide sprites just outside the screen),
    but outside of those bounds everything with the autoKill flag dies.
	
[ ] Support for changing BlendModes (NORMAL, ADD, ???)
[ ] Create a helper image for determining the values of certain angles.
[ ] Support rendering of IStyledText with TextDrawable and Renderer.
[ ] The main field should be created from the script, not from Game.

[ ] Is it possible to script a player?
[ ] Create a "Boss extends Sprite" object to help with Boss creation? Or is
    such an object better created from Lua?
[ ] Objects should be able to specify which field they want to be spawned in.
    Require it as the first constructor argument and default to 1 if absent?
[ ] Implement pausing in a way that's accessible from the script and the script
    must also be able to control the pause menu. Perhaps have the pause
    function take a LFunction argument??
[ ] Make the BGM cycle-synced to the gameplay (make sure to pause it along with
    the game)
