[ ] ---

Feature requests:
[ ] The buffered rendering in Renderer is awesomely fast, but it should:
    [ ] Group draw calls by texture instead of hoping the draw calls are
        ordered in a way to minimize state changes
    [ ] Take z-order into account by sorting the draw commands before drawing
[ ] Make the BGM cycle-synced to the gameplay (make sure to pause it along with
    the game)
