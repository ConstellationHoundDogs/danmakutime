
Bugs:
[ ] Lua's include/require functions are broken.

Feature requests:

=== Day 6 ====================================================================    

[x] Thread.new should pass arguments 2..* to the called function.
[x] Add a globalReset function taking a func + arguments and resetting
    everything except creating a new thread with the supplied function.
[x] Player invincibilityTime after getting hit.
[x] Boss indicator sprite
[x] Add pause/unpause functionality to the script. Game shouldn't be the one
    activating the pause screen. The script wants to be able to pause too when
    the player loses all their lives.
[x] Restart level option/on dead menu handler
[x] How does the user specify which SoundEngine they want?
[x] Helper function for 2d parallax scrolling backgrounds.
[x] Character dialog boxes?
[x] Add optional sprite display to the Dialog pages, left=?, right=? 

=== Day 7 ====================================================================    

[x] Document the collision interfaces
[x] Document how to change build settings / Config settings
[x] Document how to change between the sound engines
[x] Documemt Drawable.update/animate
[x] Write documentation on the wiki

[x] Upload the Javadoc as a download on the google code page
[x] Upload the final build as a download on google code

==============================================================================

[x] When the player is above the item get line, don't move the items for one
    frame at a time. They need to be magnetized until the player dies.
[ ] A damage flash on enemies? Implement by spawning a thread (to avoid
    hindering game creators from overriding either update or animate)?
    ^ Give sprites their own thread pool?
[ ] Add a second global preferencestore for use by the Lua scripts to store
    highscores, unlocks, etc.
[ ] Add an EdgeRule enum {CLAMP, WRAP} to allow the colfield to be use for tube
    shooters?     
[ ] Give the Lua scripts a way to read/write files.
[ ] The # operator doesn't return the length of a Java array.
[ ] Try to print a Lua stack trace in case of Lua errors
[ ] Replays
[ ] Key config    
[ ] Joypad support
[ ] This silliness with the boundingrectradius needs to stop, a proper bounding
    rect is much more accurate. A more limited bounding rect could reduce the
    number of grid cells we sould need to check in ColGrid.
    Or I could intersect the object with the colgrid cells in some way? 
[ ] 3D backgrounds?
