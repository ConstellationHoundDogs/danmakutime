[x] ?? What happens with the clip rect if FBO's aren't available and
    size != virtualSize...

Feature requests:
[x] Create functionality to render text on-screen
[x] Currently, all coordinates are absoute, but things that are in fields
    should have coordinates relative to the field it's in...

[ ] Support for changing BlendModes (NORMAL, ADD, ???)
[ ] Support rendering of IStyledText with TextDrawable and Renderer.
[ ] The main field should be created from the script, not from Game.
[ ] Sprites should have a togglable out-of-bounds death.	

[ ] Is it possible to script a player?
[ ] Create a "Boss extends Sprite" object to help with Boss creation? Or is
    such an object better created from Lua?
[ ] Objects should be able to specify which field they want to be spawned in.
    Require it as the first constructor argument and default to 1 if absent?
[ ] Implement pausing in a way that's accessible from the script and the script
    must also be able to control the pause menu. Perhaps have the pause
    function take a LFunction argument??
[ ] Make the BGM cycle-synced to the gameplay (make sure to pause it along with
    the game)
