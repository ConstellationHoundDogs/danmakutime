
Bugs:
[ ] The javalualib returns an LMethod without checking if any method with
    that name actually exists. This is probably because overloading must be
    resolved at call time (we don't know which function exactly will be needed)
    It should return null if no method with that name exists.
    I SHOULD IMPLEMENT MY OWN VERSION OF LuajavaLib.java    

Feature requests:
[ ] Draw focus/hitbox images with the default player script
[ ] Add additional collision shapes: line segment, polygon.
[ ] Think about bosses with lifebars, timeouts and spellcards. How would one
    implement those and how can I help.
[ ] Create a "Boss extends Sprite" object to help with Boss creation? Or is
    such an object better created from Lua?
    
[ ] How does the user specify which SoundEngine they want?
[ ] Add scale attributes to drawables. Renderer need not change, the drawable
    can handle the width & height change itself in its draw method.
[ ] There should be two separate anchors for the TextDrawable:
    1. text box anchor
    2. text inside the box anchor
[ ] Support rendering of IStyledText with TextDrawable and Renderer.
