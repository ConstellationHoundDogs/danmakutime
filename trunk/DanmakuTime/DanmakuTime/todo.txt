
Bugs:
[ ] The javalualib returns an LMethod without checking if any method with
    that name actually exists. This is probably because overloading must be
    resolved at call time (we don't know which function exactly will be needed)
    It should return null if no method with that name exists.
    I SHOULD IMPLEMENT MY OWN VERSION OF LuajavaLib.java    

Feature requests:
[ ] Implement line segment <-> line segment collision test
[ ] Add additional collision shapes: polygon.
[ ] Think about bosses with lifebars, timeouts and spellcards. How would one
    implement those and how can I help.
[ ] Create a "Boss extends Sprite" object to help with Boss creation? Or is
    such an object better created from Lua?
[ ] Document the collision interfaces    
[ ] How does the user specify which SoundEngine they want?
[ ] Add scale attributes to drawables. Renderer need not change, the drawable
    can handle the width & height change itself in its draw method.
