
Bugs:

Feature requests:
[ ] Is it possible to script a player?
[ ] Create a "Boss extends Sprite" object to help with Boss creation? Or is
    such an object better created from Lua?
    
[x] Create the sound engine: Two implementations, one using hard audio sync
    with an explicit vorbisreader and another using SoundManager without
    proper audio sync.
[x] Make the BGM cycle-synced to the gameplay (make sure to pause it along with
    the game)
[ ] How does the user specify which SoundEngine they want?

[ ] Support rendering of IStyledText with TextDrawable and Renderer.
