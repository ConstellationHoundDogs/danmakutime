Feature requests:
[ ] Instead of 1 main func, there should be a pool of N threads...
[x] The buffered rendering in Renderer is awesomely fast, but it should:
    [x] Group draw calls by texture instead of hoping the draw calls are
        ordered in a way to minimize state changes
    [x] Take z-order into account by sorting the draw commands before drawing
[ ] Make a drawAngle mode similar to the one in TouhouDS: auto (drawAngle=angle)
    or manual (drawAngle doesn't change with angle)    
[ ] Make the BGM cycle-synced to the gameplay (make sure to pause it along with
    the game)
